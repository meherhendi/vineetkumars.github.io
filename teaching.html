<h3> Digital Strategy (MGT 857) </h3>
This is an elective class designed for graduate students at the Yale School of Management.
Others who are interested in registering for the course should send an e-mail with a 1-paragraph description of your interest, as well as Resume and Course List by e-mail: <a href="mailto:vineet.kumar@yale.edu">vineet.kumar@yale.edu</a>.

<h4>Course Objectives</h4>
The course is designed to provide a strategic perspective on digital technologies, but given the broad scope of the topic, aiming for comprehensive coverage does not seem feasible. So we've had to make tradeoffs in selecting areas to examine in depth. My goal is that a student who completes the course successfully should be able to:
<ul>
<li> Understand growth and monetization tradeoffs in adopting business models </li>
<li> Determine whether a disruptor or complementor strategy is more appropriate </li>
<li> Evaluate design and governance decisions for platforms </li>
<li> Understand challenges and opportunities involved in undertaking a digital transformation </li>
<li> Develop a perspective about new emerging technologies that could potentially reshape markets and have important strategic consequences for firms </li>
</ul>

<h4>Course Description</h4>
Digital Strategy is a short half-semester course that builds upon topics in strategy, marketing and economics to understand issues in high-tech markets. Through a mix of case studies and lectures, the course brings together a variety of issues unique to markets significantly impacted by technologies. The course is divided into 4 modules. Each module will feature a lecture session laying out the conceptual foundations followed by 2-3 case studies.

First, we begin by studying the essential elements of <B> business models</B>, and examine why we observe a variety of business models in the market, and identify opportunities and challenges in adopting these models. Second, we focus on understanding strategies that can be used by  <B> disruptors and complementors </B> , with a view to evaluating how each of these could be successful in the marketplace. Third, we focus on platforms to understand the primary issues in developing  <B> multi-sided platforms </B>  as well as the perspective of participants on platforms. Fourth, we examine  <B> technology-driven transformation</B>  both from a technology perspective (with blockchain), as well as from a firm perspective (with The New York Times).
