<h2> Digital Strategy (MGT 857) </h2>
This is an elective class designed for graduate students at the Yale School of Management.
Others who are interested in registering for the course should send an e-mail with a 1-paragraph description of your interest, as well as Resume and Course List by e-mail.

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
The course is designed to provide a strategic perspective on digital technologies, but given the broad scope of the topic, aiming for comprehensive coverage in 13 sessions does not seem feasible. So Iâ€™ve had to make tradeoffs in selecting areas to examine in depth. My goal is that a student who completes the course successfully should be able to:
<ul>
<li> Understand growth and monetization tradeoffs in adopting business models </li>
<li> Determine whether a disruptor or complementor strategy is more appropriate </li>
<li> Evaluate design and governance decisions for platforms </li>
<li> Understand challenges and opportunities involved in undertaking a digital transformation </li>
<li> Develop a perspective about new emerging technologies that could potentially reshape markets and have important strategic consequences for firms </li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Description</h3>
Digital Strategy is a short half-semester course that builds upon topics in strategy, marketing and economics to understand issues in high-tech markets. Through a mix of case studies and lectures, the course brings together a variety of issues unique to markets significantly impacted by technologies. The course is divided into 4 modules. Each module will feature a lecture session laying out the conceptual foundations followed by 2-3 case studies.

First, we begin by studying the essential elements of <B> business models</B>, and examine why we observe a variety of business models in the market, and identify opportunities and challenges in adopting these models. Second, we focus on understanding strategies that can be used by  <B> disruptors and complementors </B> , with a view to evaluating how each of these could be successful in the marketplace. Third, we focus on platforms to understand the primary issues in developing  <B> multi-sided platforms </B>  as well as the perspective of participants on platforms. Fourth, we examine  <B> technology-driven transformation</B>  both from a technology perspective (with blockchain), as well as from a firm perspective (with The New York Times).
