<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<body>
<nav>
Vineet Kumar is a faculty member at Yale School of Management, and an expert on Digital Technologies. 

His  interests are in studying the marketing of technology markets, especially for digital products and services, with a view to understanding how managers and firms can design, develop and take to market products that have a huge potential for transforming peopleâ€™s everyday lives. Products and Services based on Digital Technology are becoming ever more ubiquitous in our daily lives. Competency in an understanding of technology is important, of course, but more crucially, I believe complementing this knowledge with a thoughtful and deep understanding of customer value and designing strategies based on such research would create enhanced value for both firms and consumers.
Technology and Digital Markets present a set of important issues. His research in this area spans the following aspects:
<ol type="A">
<li> Consumer choices in Complex and Dynamic settings
<li> Direct and Indirect Networkeffects
<li> Technology Transformation
<li> Big Data (especially high frequency microdata)
</ol>
His substantive focus areas include the study of digital products and services, with specific focus on product and pricing strategies.
Another studies seeding stratgies on networks as well as network effects
He studies how firms should create and deliver value drivers in digital products and services, and strategies firms should adopt in developing and marketing digital products.
